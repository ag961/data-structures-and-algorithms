# 401-JS: Code Challenge 6 - Linked List Insertions

## Challenge

Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

- append
  - arguments: new value
  - adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
- insert before
  - arguments: value, new value
  - adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
- insert after
  - arguments: value, new value
  - adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

  I am using a WHILE loop to iterate through the list from start to end. Hence, the Big O for time is (n);

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
- append
  - adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
- insert before
  - adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
- to string
  - adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified
